    ; 0. Retire any live upper-YMM state BEFORE the legacy-SSE block below.
    ; A fiber that parks straight out of an AVX kernel leaves the upper halves of YMM live, and
    ; every movdqa below then pays an SSE/AVX transition. Measured at 85.8 ns/switch against
    ; 9.2 ns with this instruction present -- see bench/context_switch.cpp, which measures this
    ; exact routine as one of its arms.
    ;
    ; Destroying that state here is LEGAL, not a liberty: the upper halves of YMM are volatile
    ; across a call under the Win64 ABI, and a context switch is an opaque call. Anything the
    ; compiler had live up there is already spilled to the fiber's own stack, which travels with
    ; the fiber. tests/avx_suspend_test.cpp is the standing check on that.
    ;
    ; One vzeroupper covers the whole routine -- the saves below AND the restores after the stack
    ; swap -- because nothing in between re-dirties the upper state.
    ;
    ; Branched rather than unconditional because vzeroupper is itself an AVX instruction; see
    ; FiberInit.cpp. The load is from one always-hot cache line and the branch is perfectly
    ; predicted, so it does not show above the noise floor of the switch it guards.
